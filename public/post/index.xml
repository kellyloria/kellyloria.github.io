Therefore, we set out to characterize seasonal rates of productivity along the nearshore of Lake Tahoe across multiple catchments that accumulate different amounts of precipitation and have unique flow regimes for three consecutive and extreme hydroclimatic years (2021 to 2023).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the future of LTPBR depends on multiple physical, ecological, and social factors, including the influence of water availability on LTPBR outcomes and the legal capacity for future restoration in water-limited environments.&#xA;A growing body of scientific and legal literature on LTPBR allows for a quantitative, regional comparison of LTPBR projects to understand:&#xA;(1) How do physical characteristics of LTPBR projects (including structure type, number, and local setting) influence the magnitude of change following LTPBR? and (2) How are social dimensions related to practitioner attitudes and water law impacting LTPBR?&#xA;We evaluated data from 65 LTPBR projects in the western U.S. that used natural beaver dams, beaver dam analogues, or one-rock dams to quantify trends in commonly measured outcomes with geographic location, project size, and local precipitation. We additionally reviewed water law in five states across the western U.S. and interviewed 13 restoration practitioners to consider the social dimensions of LTPBR. Results show that LTPBR projects significantly increased water storage, sediment storage, and riparian vegetation greenness, and that outcomes vary significantly with mean annual precipitation, time since restoration, and LTPBR type. Trends suggest that LTPBR could provide expected outcomes across western rangelands even amid changing water availability. Changes to state-level water laws and perceptions of social benefits of LTPBR could support the expansion of stream restoration in rangeland streams. More monitoring and collaborations are needed to better implement, manage, and understand LTPBR projects and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Uptake rates appear to increased with nitrate supply and surprisingly decreased with epilithic algal biomass. These results could suggest that summertime epilithic algal biomass is not necessarily limited by nitrate supply and is instead more governed by environmental forcing (water temperature and flow).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Declines in alpine lake ice</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-thin-ice-linking-elevation-and-long-term-losses-of-lake-ice-cover&#34;&gt;On thin ice: Linking elevation and long-term losses of lake ice cover&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is expected to have particularly strong effects in colder regions, such as those at high elevations. Yet due to remote locations and sparse data, it is unknown how mountain lakes are actually changing compared to other lakes in other regions. By assessing ice phenology trends for one of the highest (&amp;gt; 3000 m) and longest-running (36 yr) datasets on mountain lakes, we find that alpine lakes are decreasing ice cover 50% faster than average for more well-studied lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, emphasizing the importance of studying mountain lakes that provide water to nearly half of the world’s population.

      <title>Long-term apline zooplankton population dynamics</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;phenology-of-alpine-zooplankton-populations-and-the-importance-of-lake-ice-out&#34;&gt;Phenology of alpine zooplankton populations and the importance of lake ice-out&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The prolonged ice cover inherent to alpine lakes incurs unique challenges for aquatic life, which are compounded by recent shifts in the timing and duration of ice cover. To understand the responses of alpine zooplankton, we analyzed a decade (2009–2019) of open-water samples of Daphnia pulicaria and Hesperodiaptomus shoshone for growth, reproduction and ultraviolet radiation tolerance (&lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-nwt&amp;amp;identifier=161&#34;&gt;Link to datasets&lt;/a&gt;). We described seasonal demographic patterns of growth, reproduction and trait expression for two common high elevation taxa Hesperodiaptomus shoshone and  Daphnia pulicaria. Throughout the course of our analysis, we observed large variation in ice cover, in particular the open water season ranged from 82 to 134 days. We found that both H. shoshone and D. pulicaria population dynamics were strongly related to water temperature, and were sensitive to the timing of lake ice clearance. Specifically we found that D. pulicaria biomass and melanization tended to be lowest immediately following ice clearance; whereas fecundity was relatively high. As the summer advanced D. pulicaria biomass and melanization linearly increased, while fecundity decreased. For example, 25% (standard deviation = 22%) of adult D. pulicaria were fecund within 20 days of ice clearance, and we observed lower rates of  fecundity (14-16%) for the remained of the open water season. In contrast, demographic patterns for H. shoshone tended to be non-linear, with peaks in biomass and fecundity around 30 to 40 days after ice-off, respectively, and we observed less variability in both metrics throughout the open water season relative to D. pulicaria. These findings will help inform future development of climate predictions for how high elevation aquatic communities are organized by providing patterns of seasonal population dynamics in natural systems and could aid in the development of a framework for how future predictions for reduced ice-cover could impact mountain lake communities across greater trophic scales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These patterns appear to be driven by the pronounced changes in climate, terrestrial inputs, and atmospheric deposition that vary substantially with altitude. Expanding our analysis to biological communities, we found compelling evidence supporting elevation as a niche filter, with gamma diversity markedly lower (46%) for lakes situated above the treeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
