      <description>Biogeochemical linkages between nitrogen availability and mountain stream metabolism I’m examining the temporal synchrony of nitrogen supply-demand relationships across multiple reaches and mountain catchments to evaluate how shifts in nitrogen supply-demand relationships may affect in-stream ecological processes in streams like algal abundance and stream metabolism.&#xA;Preliminary results suggest uptake length increased with nitrate supply and decreased with epilithic algal biomass. Uptake rates appear to increased with nitrate supply and surprisingly decreased with epilithic algal biomass.</description>

      <description>Upstream efficiency and downstream productivity: Linking mountain stream processes with near-shore productivity in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Upland processes (snowmelt, streamflow, and stream temperature) can influence littoral (nearshore) productivity dynamics through modulating the timing and delivery of materials to lakes. The degree to which upland processes influence nearshore productivity as a function of their catchment characteristics relative to the influence of internal lake processes remains unclear. We continuously monitored dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance (SPC) at different depths in the nearshore of Lake Tahoe CA/NV, USA and at the outlets of two watersheds with differing flow regimes for three consecutive years.</description>

      <description>Phenology of alpine zooplankton populations and the importance of lake ice-out The prolonged ice cover inherent to alpine lakes incurs unique challenges for aquatic life, which are compounded by recent shifts in the timing and duration of ice cover. To understand the responses of alpine zooplankton, we analyzed a decade (2009–2019) of open-water samples of Daphnia pulicaria and Hesperodiaptomus shoshone for growth, reproduction and ultraviolet radiation tolerance (Link to datasets). We described seasonal demographic patterns of growth, reproduction and trait expression for two common high elevation taxa Hesperodiaptomus shoshone and Daphnia pulicaria.</description>
