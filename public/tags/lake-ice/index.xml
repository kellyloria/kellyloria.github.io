      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-thin-ice-linking-elevation-and-long-term-losses-of-lake-ice-cover&#34;&gt;On thin ice: Linking elevation and long-term losses of lake ice cover&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is expected to have particularly strong effects in colder regions, such as those at high elevations. Yet due to remote locations and sparse data, it is unknown how mountain lakes are actually changing compared to other lakes in other regions. By assessing ice phenology trends for one of the highest (&amp;gt; 3000 m) and longest-running (36 yr) datasets on mountain lakes, we find that alpine lakes are decreasing ice cover 50% faster than average for more well-studied lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, emphasizing the importance of studying mountain lakes that provide water to nearly half of the worldâ€™s population.
