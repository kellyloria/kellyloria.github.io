I received my B.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado where post-graduation; I led the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Program’s alpine lake monitoring. In this role, I investigated spatial and temporal trends in alpine zooplankton communities, lake water quality, and the potential for climate change to alter the timing of physical signals like lake ice cover, peak lake inflow, and degree of lake stratification.

Currently, I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology Program at the University of Nevada Reno where I collaborate with USGS scientists, hydrologists, ecologists, and biologists to investigate patterns in hydroclimate, water quality, and metabolism in both inflowing streams as well as the nearshore of Lake Tahoe (CA/NV). I’m especially interested in how climate change may cause phenological mismatches between physical signals and biogeochemical responses in aquatic ecosystems.
