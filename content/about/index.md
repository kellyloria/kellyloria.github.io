I recieved my B.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado where I stuck around post-graduation to lead the the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Program’s monitoring of alpine lakes. In this role, I investigated spatial and temporal trends in alpine zooplankton communities their lake water water quatlity and potential for climate change to alter the timing of physical signals like lake ice-cover, peak lake inflow, and degree of lake stratification.

I'm very interested in how climate change may cause phenological mis-matches physical signals, and biogeochemical responses in aquatic ecosystems. I’m currently a graduate candidate in the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program at the University of Nevada Reno where I collaborate with USGS scientists, hydrologists, ecologists, and biologists, at both University of California Davis as well as the University of Nevada Reno to investigate patterns in dissloved oxgen and model metabolism in inflowing streams and the nearshore of Lake Tahoe.
