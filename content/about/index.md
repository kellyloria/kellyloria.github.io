I received my B.A. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado where I stuck around post-graduation to lead the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Program’s monitoring of alpine lakes. In this role, I investigated spatial and temporal trends in alpine zooplankton communities their lake water quality and potential for climate change to alter the timing of physical signals like lake ice-cover, peak lake inflow, and degree of lake stratification.

I’m interested in how climate change may cause phenological mis-matches physical signals and biogeochemical responses in aquatic ecosystems. I’m currently a graduate candidate in the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program at the University of Nevada Reno where I collaborate with USGS scientists, hydrologists, ecologists, and biologists, investigate patterns in dissolved oxygen and model metabolism in inflowing streams and the nearshore of Lake Tahoe.
