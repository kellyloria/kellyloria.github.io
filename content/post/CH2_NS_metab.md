## **Upstream efficiency and downstream productivity:** The influence of mountain streamflow on nearshore metabolism in a large, oligotrophic lake across dry and wet years.

Streams transform and transport materials and nutrients based on the availability of organic matter, woody debris1, sediment1, and watershed attributes such as land use2, residence time, hydrologic connectivity, and catchment size3,4 and are indicative of large-scale ecosystem change5. Current warming trends and the expected variability in the timing and intensity of precipitation in mountain regions could also alter the availability of key resources and as well as physical processes, with unknown effects on ecosystem energy fluxes (i.e., primary productivity- GPP and ecosystem respiration- ER). Therefore, we set out to characterize seasonal rates of productivity along the nearshore of Lake Tahoe across multiple catchments that accumulate different amounts of precipitation and have unique flow regimes for three consecutive and extreme hydroclimatic years (2021to 2023).

We deployed networks of dissolved oxygen sensors (three sensors per-shore) to create a large high resolution time series of modeled metabolism across four difference nearshore (3 m deep) locations. Past work in Tahoe has focused on synoptic discrete measures of algal biomass and bottle incubations to estimate rates of GPP and ER. Here we sought to capture relative quick nearshore responses to precipitation events as well as seasonal regimes by capturing daily GPP and ER, weather, and streamflow dynamics.

Areas near inflowing streams tended to be more heterotrophic, while areas away from streams appeared more autotrophic. Intra-annually, we typically observed elevated productivity at all locations in the spring and late fall9 likely following patterns of turbulent lake mixing and carbon and nutrients distributions10, 12, 13. During 2023 the water yield increased by 83% at both west and east shore creeks and lake level increased by up to 1.65 m. We additionally observed metabolic regimes with higher annual GPP during dry (2021) relative to wet (2023) hydroclimatic conditions. This trend supports similar work in mountain lakes where drier years (2021) favored autotrophic metabolism, while wetter hydroclimatic conditions (2023) favored heterotrophic metabolism11. We expect that all nearshore locations in 2023 were subject to prolonged run-off conditions (e.g. heightened material transport as well as enhanced turbulent mixing) following the historic winter and ultimately favored heterotrophic conditions in the nearshore.
