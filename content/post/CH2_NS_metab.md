## **Upstream efficiency and downstream productivity:** Linking mountain stream processes with near-shore productivity in the Lake Tahoe Basin.

Upland processes (snowmelt, streamflow, and stream temperature) can influence littoral (nearshore) productivity dynamics through modulating the timing and delivery of materials to lakes. The degree to which upland processes influence nearshore productivity as a function of their catchment characteristics relative to the influence of internal lake processes remains unclear. We continuously monitored dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance (SPC) at different depths in the nearshore of Lake Tahoe CA/NV, USA and at the outlets of two watersheds with differing flow regimes for three consecutive years. Nearshore gross primary productivity (GPP) immediately around inflowing streams was up to 60% higher relative to areas 1 km or more away from surface water inflows. 

Across all locations, GPP was strongly related to the previous days’ GPP and negatively associated with variation in daily shortwave radiation, wind speed, and stream water SPC. Our findings indicate that nearshore metabolism is sensitive to daily variations in weather; these patterns were more pronounced for the west shore of Lake Tahoe which accumulates greater amounts of annual precipitation, typically as snow, relative to the drier east shore. Additionally, the impact of upland processes on nearshore metabolism varied with winter precipitation, indicating drier years may lead to increased nearshore GPP.  Given the anticipated climate warming in western US mountain basins, changes to upland processes (i.e. warmer temperatures, prolonged droughts, and enhanced groundwater nutrient delivery), may also promote unwanted algal growth.
