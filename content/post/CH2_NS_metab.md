This work examines how streamflow influences nearshore productivity in Lake Tahoe under contrasting wet and dry years, focusing on shorelines with varying inflow levels. By evaluating streamflow for shores with large, small, or no stream inflows (four locations across two shores) during two contrasting water years (one drought and one wet), this work showed how streamflow reduces water temperature, light availability, to indirectly influence nearshore metabolism in ways that varied with inflow size.  This work underscores how oligotrophic littoral productivity varies across shorelines and in response to hydrological conditions, with streamflow and precipitation exerting contrasting effects on metabolism depending on the proximity to inflowing streams.

Stars represent large differences ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05) in NEP from wet and dry years. Color corresponds to site (BW in blue, GB in gold, SS in green, and SH in orange), and shading represents the upper (95%) or lower (5%) credible intervals of each posterior estimate of daily GPP or ER.</h6>

      <h6 style="font-size: 12px;">Path diagram representing the Piecewise Bayesian structural equation model (SEM) of how metabolism (metab., as either gross primary productivity [GPP] or ecosystem respiration [|ER|]) is a function of the day prior’s metabolism (AR as GPPt-1 or |ER|t-1), benthic water temperature (temp.), benthic light, or streamflow (flow), while accounting for how benthic water temperature and benthic light could also be functions as both streamflow and precipitation (as PPT). The box color for each parameter represents the type of process associated with a given parameter (light blue for stream, dark blue for lake, teal for climate, and gray for autoregressive). b & c) Posterior estimates of path coefficients from SEMs for b) GPP in nmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> or c) |ER| in nmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> at shore locations with either a large stream inflow (BW in blue), a small stream inflow, (GB in gold), or isolated from stream inflows (SS in green). Water year is represented by fill color transparent for drought (2022) or filled for wet (2023).</h6>
