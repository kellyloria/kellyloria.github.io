## The life aquatic in high relief: shifts in the physical and biological characteristics of alpine lakes along an elevation gradient in the Rocky Mountains, USA ##

In 2016 I lead a survey of mountain lakes  ranging from 2480 to 3550 m a.s.l. in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. to investigate differences in ecological proccesses associated with landscape position.

Employing a mixed modeling framework, we uncovered noteworthy associations between elevation and nearly all measured physiochemical parameters affecting water quality. These patterns appear to be driven by the pronounced changes in climate, terrestrial inputs, and atmospheric deposition that vary substantially with altitude. Expanding our analysis to biological communities, we found compelling evidence supporting elevation as a niche filter, with gamma diversity markedly lower (46%) for lakes situated above the treeline.

Furthermore, we observed that in-lake communities exhibited greater dissimilarity based on elevation distance rather than UTM distance, defined here as the Euclidean distance between latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. Lakes separated by 500 UTM meters were only 4% dissimilar, while those differing by 500 feet in elevation were, on average, 21% dissimilar. This underscores the pronounced impact of elevation on the composition of in-lake communities. ([Link to datasets](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.12.1))
